# Formal Security Proof of the Token Distribution Protocol

This repository contains the code of the formal proof for the token distribution protocol used in the Automotive Service-Oriented Software Architecture.

There are two files:

1. *tamarin_proof_secmem*: This file contains the proof for the "TokDist-SecMem" version of the token distribution protocol.
2. *tamarin_proof_puf*: This file contains the proof for the "TokDist-PUF" version of the token distribution protocol.

For comprehensive details and insights, please consult the paper titled "A Security Process for Automotive Service-Oriented Software Architecture," which has been published in the IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology.
